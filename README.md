# Background
THis is the python manipulation codes for paper: 
"Explore the effects of spatial variability in vegetation phenology, climate, landcover, biodiversity, topography, and soil property on soil respiration across a coastal ecosystem by multi-source remote sensing".
(1), Investigate the spatial heterogeneity of the coastal ecosystem and identify spatial zones with similar environmental characteristics based on the spatial data layers; 
(2), Understand the primary driving factors affecting soil respiration within sub-ecosystems of the coastal ecosystem using Random Forest regression and SHapley Additive exPlanations).
