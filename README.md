"Explore the effects of spatial variability in vegetation phenology, climate, landcover, biodiversity, topography, and soil property on soil respiration across a coastal ecosystem by multi-source remote sensing"
(1), investigate the spatial heterogeneity of the coastal ecosystem and identify spatial zones with similar environmental characteristics based on the spatial data layers, including vegetation index (kNDVI), climate, landcover, diversity, topography, soil property, and relative tidal elevation (hierarchical agglomerative clustering and post hoc pairwise hypothesis t-tests ); 
(2), understand the primary driving factors affecting soil respiration within sub-ecosystems of the coastal ecosystem (Random Forest regression and SHapley Additive exPlanations).
